Peppa Pig第二季
 01 Bubbles 泡泡
Peppa and George are drinking orange juice.
What a noise! Little piggies! 
"George, look at all the tiny bubbles.” 
I can make bigger bubbles. 
Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink. 
George wants to blow bubbles too.
"Peppa, George, you really"shouldn't play with your food!
"Sorry, Daddy."
"Peppa, if you like bubbles,”
Why don't you play with your bubble mixture?
Yes! My bubble mixture! 
"George, let's blow bubbles in the garden.” 
Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles. 
"First, dip the stick in the mixture.”
"Then, take a big breath and blow.” 
Heeee... bubble!
"George, now it's your turn!” 
"Dip the stick in the mixture,” 
"hold it up,"
"take big breath," 
and blow!
"George is trying really hard,"
but he’s running out of breath!
"George, you didn't blow hard enough!"
I know a way George can make bubbles.
"Dip the stick in the mixture,"
then lift it up and wave it around.
Bubble!
It's even better if you run along.  
Wait for me!
"George is having fun making bubbles,"
and Peppa is having fun popping.
I love bubbles!
"Oh, dear! The bubble mixture is all used up."
"Daddy, Mummy!"
There's no more bubble mixture!  
"Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea."
"Mummy Pig, bring me a bucket, please!"
Yes! Daddy Pig.
"Peppa, bring me some soap!”
"Yes, Daddy Pig."
"George, bring me my old tennis racket."
"A bucket, some soap, a tennis racket!"
What is Daddy Pig doing?
"First, I need some water."
"Then, the soap."
"And now, the tennis racket, please!"
Thank you!
Now watch this!
Woo... Wow!
Daddy Pig has made his own bubble mixture.
"Come on, everyone!"
Be careful! Daddy Pig! Don't slip and fall.
I'll be fine! Wow… 
"Are you Ok, Daddy Pig?” 
"Yes, I'm fine!” 
Wow!
Daddy Pig has made the biggest bubble ever! 
Oh dear! I've spilled all my bubble mixture.
"Now, we can't make any more bubbles!"
But we can play jumping in muddy puddles! Look!
Daddy Pig's bubble mixture has made a big muddy puddle!
Hurray!
Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles!
Look! The bubble mixture has made the puddle all bubbly! 
Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy bubbly puddles!
Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy bubbly puddles!


02 Teddy’s day out
Teddy's day out
Peppa and her family are going out for the day.
Daddy Pig has made a picnic.
"Peppa, George, have you got your stuff ready?"
"Yes, I'm taking teddy!"
Dinosaur!
"If you take your toys, you must look after them!"
"Yes, Mummy!"
Are we all ready?
"Yes, Daddy Pig!"
Then let's go!
Dinosaur!
George has left Mr. Dinosaur behind.
Oh George, you should take more care of Mr. Dinosuar!
Dinosaur!
Are we all absolutely sure we haven't forgotten anything else?
"Yes, Daddy Pig!"
Teddy! I've left Teddy!
Where did you leave teddy?
"I think, on the kitchen table."
"Peppa, you really must take more care of Teddy!"
Teddy!
Here we go again!
All ready?
"Yes, Daddy Pig"
Here we go!
This is the picnic area.
We are here!
Hooray!
Ah... I love this picnic spot!
It's so quiet and peaceful!
"It is Zoey Zebra with her daddy,"
Mr. Zebra the postman.
Hello Mr. Zebra!
Have you got all post?
"Ho~~Ho, no delivery today!"
It is my day off!
"Neigh, we're having a picnic lunch."
So are we!
"I know, why don't we make one big picnic?"
Yes!
What a splendid picnic!
Please may George and I leave the table and play with Zoey!
Yes Peppa!
"Zoey, I've got my Teddy!"
I've got my monkey!
Dinosaur!
I've got a toy picnic set!
Let's play picnics!
"Oh, it's the ducks!"
They always turn up when we have a picnic.
We've got pretend orange juice.
And we've got pretend cake.
"It's pretend cake, it's very nice"
"Oh, dear. I do not think"
the ducks want pretend cake!
"Oh, well. That means there's more for monkey,"
Mr. Dinosaur and teddy!
"Hum, delicious"
"Monkey says, the best cake ever!"
Peppa George home time!
"Bye-bye, Zoey"
Bye-bye!
Are we all ready?
"Yes, Daddy Pig"
"Home time for us, too, Zoey."
"Yes, daddy!"
"Cups, plates, monkey, teddy."
"Oh, no! You shouldn't be here, teddy!"
"Peppa has forgotten her teddy, again!"
Peppa and her family are home.
That's enough driving for one day.
All I want to do now is relax!
Put my feet up and watch some...
Teddy!
I forgot Teddy!
Oh Peppa, now Daddy Pig will have to drive all the way back to the picnic spot.
Huh... Yes of course!
"It's Mr. Zebra, the postman"
"I thought it was your day off today, Mr. Zebra."
It is my day off! But Zoey's got a very special delivery for a Miss Peppa pig.
"Here you are, Peppa"
What is it?
It's teddy!
"You left teddy behind,"
So we brought him home.
Thank you Zoey!
Teddy certainly has had an exciting day out.
"But Peppa, you really must take better care of him."
Yes Mummy. You're a very naughty teddy!
You must promise not to wander off ever again.
"Sorry, Peppa. I promise."
