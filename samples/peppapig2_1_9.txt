Why don't you play with your bubble mixture?
Yes! My bubble mixture! 
"George, let's blow bubbles in the garden.” 
Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles. 
"First, dip the stick in the mixture.”
"Then, take a big breath and blow.” 
Heeee... bubble!
"George, now it's your turn!” 
"Dip the stick in the mixture,” 
"hold it up,"
"take big breath," 
and blow!
"George is trying really hard,"
but he’s running out of breath!

then lift it up and wave it around.
Bubble!
It's even better if you run along.  
Wait for me!
"George is having fun making bubbles,"
and Peppa is having fun popping.

"Daddy, Mummy!"
There's no more bubble mixture!  
"Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea."
"Mummy Pig, bring me a bucket, please!"
Yes! Daddy Pig.
"Peppa, bring me some soap!”
"Yes, Daddy Pig."
"George, bring me my old tennis racket."
