Peppa and George are drinking orange juice.
What a noise! Little piggies! 
"George, look at all the tiny bubbles.” 
I can make bigger bubbles. 
Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink. 
George wants to blow bubbles too.
"Peppa, George, you really"shouldn't play with your food!
"Sorry, Daddy."
"Peppa, if you like bubbles,”
Why don't you play with your bubble mixture?
Yes! My bubble mixture! 
"George, let's blow bubbles in the garden.” 
Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles. 
"First, dip the stick in the mixture.”
"Then, take a big breath and blow.” 
Heeee... bubble!
"George, now it's your turn!” 
"Dip the stick in the mixture,” 
"hold it up,"
"take big breath," 
and blow!
"George is trying really hard,"
but he’s running out of breath!
"George, you didn't blow hard enough!"
I know a way George can make bubbles.
"Dip the stick in the mixture,"
then lift it up and wave it around.
Bubble!
It's even better if you run along.  
Wait for me!
"George is having fun making bubbles,"
and Peppa is having fun popping.
I love bubbles!
"Oh, dear! The bubble mixture is all used up."
"Daddy, Mummy!"
There's no more bubble mixture!  
"Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea."
"Mummy Pig, bring me a bucket, please!"
Yes! Daddy Pig.
"Peppa, bring me some soap!”
"Yes, Daddy Pig."
"George, bring me my old tennis racket."
"A bucket, some soap, a tennis racket!"
What is Daddy Pig doing?
"First, I need some water."
"Then, the soap."
"And now, the tennis racket, please!"
Thank you!
Now watch this!
Woo... Wow!
Daddy Pig has made his own bubble mixture.
"Come on, everyone!"
Be careful! Daddy Pig! Don't slip and fall.
I'll be fine! Wow… 
"Are you Ok, Daddy Pig?” 
"Yes, I'm fine!” 
Wow!
Daddy Pig has made the biggest bubble ever!

"Oh, no! You shouldn't be here, teddy!"
"Peppa has forgotten her teddy, again!"
Peppa and her family are home.
That's enough driving for one day.
All I want to do now is relax!
Put my feet up and watch some...
Teddy!
I forgot Teddy!
Oh Peppa, now Daddy Pig will have to drive all the way back to the picnic spot.
Huh... Yes of course!
"It's Mr. Zebra, the postman"
"I thought it was your day off today, Mr. Zebra."
It is my day off! But Zoey's got a very special delivery for a Miss Peppa pig.
"Here you are, Peppa"
What is it?
It's teddy!
"You left teddy behind,"
So we brought him home.
Thank you Zoey!
Teddy certainly has had an exciting day out.
"But Peppa, you really must take better care of him."
Yes Mummy. You're a very naughty teddy!
You must promise not to wander off ever again.
"Sorry, Peppa. I promise."

That was easy. I can do that.
"Haha, I’m sure you could, peppa."
"Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a famous detective.
"George wants to be a detective, too."
If you're going to be detectives, you each need a hat.
Detectives always wear hats.
Now you look like two proper detectives.
And we need one of those funny things that makes everything look big?
A magnifying glass.							放大镜
I think we've got one in the kitchen drawer. 抽屉

A real magnifying glass.
Wow! How does it work?
"You hold it in front of things, and they look bigger.

The magnifying glass makes George's eyes look very big.
Now what you detectives need is a mystery to solve.
"Daddy, what is a ""miss story'?"
A mystery is something detectives are good at sorting out,
like finding things that are lost.
I know, 
we can find George's toy dinosaur.
That's always getting lost.
Dinosaur.
Mr. Dinosaur is not lost.
"What about your glasses, daddy?"
You are always losing them.

What are those little things on the floor?
The cake crumbs.			食物碎屑

I wonder if teddy has been eating cake.
And the crumbs lead this way.
Teddy's been eating a lot of cake.

No.
Is teddy some where high up?
Yes.
Teddy's in my bed.

But we wanted to make sand castles.
Peppa and George love making sand castles.
"No, no, George. Don't be upset!"
There are lots of exciting things to do on this rocky beach.
Like what?
"When the sea goes out, it leaves little pools"
of water in amongst the rocks.
That called rock pools.
"And in these rock pools, there's something special that the sea has left behind.
I can see something glittering. 		闪闪发光
It's a coin.
Maybe it's a pirate's treasure.
Let's make a collection of all the things we find.

we'll put them in George's bucket.
What surprise is waiting in this pool?
There's nothing special in this one.

I love my seashell.
"George, can you find a seashell, too?"
Shell!
That's not a shell.
Oh.
Peppa's right.
That's not a shell.
George has found a fossil.
What's a fossil?
A fossil is the remains of an animal that lived long ago when there were dinosaurs.
Dinosaur!
Rock pools are such fun!
"Yes, they are fun for us."
But not for this little fish.
A fish!
Where?
Poor little fish. She's trapped.  			困住
The little fish says she wants to go back to the sea.
Maybe you could use your bucket to rescue her.
Yes.
Peppa is rescuing the little fish in her bucket.
"Don't worry, Mrs. Fish."

that scares birds away.
"What a good idea, Granny Pig!"
I'll make one!
"Come on, everyone."
"Bye bye, Little birds!"
We're going to make a scarecrow.
This is Grandpa pig's garden shed.
There'll be plenty of things in here
to make a scarecrow.
"First, we need two sticks"
and some strings.
We'll find them.
Peppa has found some sticks.
George has found some string.
Good! I'll tie the sticks together
to make the body.
Granny Pig has found some straw and an old sack.
Lovely! I'll put the straw in the sack
to make the head.
"Now, the scarecrow"
needs something to wear.
Here's a bag of old clothes.
Oooh!
George has found a dress.
Silly George!
Mr. Scarecrow doesn't
want to wear a dress.
Peppa has found a coat.
Very good! Peppa.
George has found a hat.
Very good! George.
Mr. Scarecrow needs a face.
That. S right.
Would you and George
like to paint a face?
"Yes, please."
George paints the eyes and nose.
Peppa paints the mouth.
Fantastic!
"Mr, Scarecrow is ready."
Hooray!
The little birds are looking for
Grandpa's flowerseeds.
Look! The little birds are back.
"Don't worry, Peppa."
Mr. Scarecrow will scare them off.
It worked.
Mr. Scarecrow has scared
the little birds away.
Hooray!
"Good! Now,"
my flower seeds will not be eaten.
"Oh, Grandpa,"
the bird look very sad.
"Yes, they must be hungry."
That's why I've brought this.
"What. S that, Granny?"
It's a birdfeeder.
"Grandpa,"
"may I have some seeds, please?"
"Come on, birdies! Lunchtime!"
"Now, the birds have their own seeds to eat."
Hooray! The little birds are happy again!
Peppa is glad that Grandpa's seeds
will not be eaten.
But she is even more glad that
the little birds will not be hungry.
 11 The Boat Pond
The Boat Pond
The ducks are swimming in their pond.
They are very happy.
"Here are Peppa, George,"
"Mummy Pig, and Daddy Pig."
"Hello, ducks."
The ducks want some bread.
"Sorry, Mrs. Duck."
We haven't got any bread today.
We've got something much more fun.
"Peppa has brought her toy boat,"
and George has brought his toy boat.
"Let's wind your boat up, George."
George's boat works with clockwork.
"Quick, George, put the boat in the pond"
before the clockwork runs out.
George loves his clockwork boat.
"Mummy, can you wind my boat up?"
"Your boat does not need winding up, Peppa."
"Peppa. S boat is a sail boat,"
the wind makes it go along.
I don't like my boat.
It doesn't do anything.
That's because there isn't any wind today.
Maybe you just need a little help.
"I'll huff, and I'll puff,"
and I'll blow your boat along.
"Hooray, it went really fast."
Peppa loves her sail boat.
"Here's Peppa's friend, Suzy Sheep."
"Hello, everyone."
"Hello, Suzy."
We're playing with our boats.
I've got my speed boat.
Is it clockwork?
"No, it has batteries."
Suzy's speed boat
uses batteries to make it go.
What a great speed boat!
"Sorry, Mrs. Duck."
"Here is Danny Dog,"
with Granddad Dog.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hello, Danny."
My Granddad has made me
this paddle boat.
I'll say that is impressive.
How does it work?
It is steam powered.
I just push this little lever.
What a fantastic paddle boat!
"Here is Rebecca Rabbit,"
with her mummy.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hello, Rebecca."
We're playing with our boats.
I wish I had a boat.
Rebecca Rabbit does not have a boat.
I've got an idea.
Luckily I've brought my newspaper along.
I just need one page.
Which page can we use?
"News, sports, ah, fashion."
Not the fashion page.
"OK, I'll use the business page."
"When I was a little piggy,"
I used to fold newspaper like this.
What is Daddy Pig doing?
To make a paper boat.
Daddy Pig has made a paper boat.
"Thank you, Mr. Pig."
George wants a paper boat too.
I suppose I can do that
with sports page.
"Please, can I have one?"
And me?
Of course.
Daddy Pig's making paper boats
for everyone.
Let's have a race.
"Good idea, Mummy Pig."
"We can huff, and puff,"
and blow the paper boats across.
Everyone takes a deep breath.
Ready? Steady? Blow!
We have a winner.
Who has this sports page?
That's George's boat.
George's the winner.
"I like boats,"
and I like paper boats the best.
Me too!
It is time to go home.
Everybody has had a great time.
Bye bye.
"Bye bye, ducks."
See you soon.
"The ducks enjoy the toy boats,"
but they quite like having the pond back
to themselves again.
 12 Recycling
Recycling
Mr. Bull the binman is collecting the rubbish.
It is early morning so Mr. Bull tries to
be as quiet as he can.
But Mr. Bull is not very good at being quiet.

"Yes, you can!"
Let's throw this empty bottle in the bin.
"Peppa, stop!"

We don't put bottles in the rubbish bin.
They can be recycled.
What does that mean?
"All the things we can't use again,"
we put in the rubbish bin for Mr. Bull.
But all the things that can be used again
are put in these recycle boxes.
The red one is for newspapers.
The blue one is for tin cars
and the green one is for bottles.
"Peppa, you have a bottle,"
so which box does it go in?
"Errm, the green one!"
Yes!
This is fun!
"Now, it's George's turn."
Can you find a newspaper forthe red box?
George wants to recycle Daddy Pig's newspaper.

"my newspaper just yet, George."
You can have it in a minute.

That. S right!
And the cans go in the blue one!
Well done! Peppa.
George wants to recycle the newspapers.
"OK, George,"
You can do the newspapers.

"If you see him, you should ask."
But Father Christmas won't come

"No, daddy!"
Ourclock doesn't work!
Oh dear.
Let's see if we can mend it.
Ah. The old cuckoo clock!
Why is it called a cuckoo clock?
There's a Little wooden bird
inside called a cuckoo.
I've never seen the cuckoo.
That's because we stopped
winding it a long time ago!
The cuckoo got a bit annoying.
Oh.
Can we wind it up again?
Please?!
Alright.

it's fun.
"Okay,"

Now I'll never find it.
Maybe it's time to cut the grass.
"Yes, daddy pig."
I. II get the lawn mower.
I am sure it's here somewhere.
Here it is.
Daddy pig has found the lawn mower.
It's a bit old and rusty.
Nonsense.
It. II have grass cut in no time.
It does a bit rusty.
Maybe i should phone grandpa pig and
ask if he could borrow us his lawn mower.
This's no need to phone grandpa.
I just need to push it a bit harder.
Daddy pig's lawn mower is not very good.
"Oh, I know,"
let's phone grandpa.
"Hello, grandpa pig speaking."
"Hello, grandpa pig,"
could you help us cut
some very long grass?
"Oh, certainly,"
I'll be over right away.

Grandpa pig is driving his motor
mower over to peppa's house.
Grandpa pig! Papa lg!
"Hello, everyone."
I hear there's some grass

And it's just a bit too long

She certainly is.
"Hello, Betsy."

Of course you can.
Hop aboard.

个人觉得因为我是姐姐更好）)"
"Watch me, George."
"Sitting in the chair, please."
Hold tight.
Whee...
"Open wide, please."
Ah...
"wider, please."
Ah...
now let's take a look
Dr. Elephant uses a little mirror
to look at Peppa's teeth.
I hope you haven't been eating
"too many sweeties, Peppa."
It is quite difficult to speak
when your mouth is wide open.
"There, all done."
What lovely clean teeth!
She takes after me.
Can I have this special pink drink now?
"Yes, but don't drink, Peppa,"
spit it out.
"George, now it's your turn."
No.
George does not want it to be his turn.
Maybe you can hold Mr. Dinosaur
while the dentist looks at you rteeth.
Gerr... Dinosaur.
"Very please to meet you, Mr. Dinosaur."
"It is not a real dinosaur,"
it's made of plastics.
Hold tight.
"You're doing very well, George."
Now can you show me your teeth?
George does not want to
show the dentist his teeth.
"George,"
"open wide, like this."
Ah... ah...
Aaaaah...
"Ah, there they are,"
all done.
"You have very strong clean teeth, George."
"Are they as lovely as mine, Dr. Elephant?"
Ah...
Yes.
George is very proud to have clean teeth.
"George, don't forget the pink drink."
"Oh, wait, what's this?"
"What's wrong, Dr Elephant?"
"George has clean teeth,"
but this young dinosaur's
teeth are very dirty.
"Oh, no."
Dr. Elephant is very cross
with Mr. Dinosaur.
"Not at all, Peppa."
It's my job to make teeth clean.
"The water jet please, Ms. Rabbit."
The dentist uses waterto
clean Mr. Dinosaur's teeth.
"The polisher, please, Ms Rabbit."
This would be a bit noisy.
Dr. Elephant polishes
Mr. Dinosaur's teeth.
"Pink, pink..."
"That's righ, George."
Mr. Dinosaur needs
some special pink drink.
"Gosh,"
what shining teeth
"you have, Mr. Dinosaur."
Err.
Dinosaur.
Too scary.
"George loves Mr. Dinosaur,"
especially now he
has nice clean teeth.

instead of in the sky.
Oooh.
"Hmm, it. S very thick fog."
I can't see a thing.
"Hmmm, maybe we should"
go back home.
"Yes, we'll go to the"
playground anotherday.
Ohh...
It is too foggy to
find the playground.
So Peppa and George
have to go back home.
"Now, which way is home?"
"Are we lost, Daddy Pig?"
Don't worry.
I know exactly
where we are.
This way.
"Oh, who put that tree there?"
Daddy pig has
walked into a tree.
"Are you OK, Daddy pig?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
This way.
"Daddy pig, do you know"
where you're going?
"Yes, of course I do."
I don't think we'll ever
find our house again.
"I'm sure we will, Peppa."
We're only in ourgarden.
"Oh, it's the ducks."
"Hello, Mrs. Duck!"
Have you lost your pond?
We're lost too.
We are not lost.
I know exactly where we are.
"See you later, Ducks."
Good luck finding your pond.
Oh
Oh.
Daddy Pig has found the duck pond.
That's lucky.
"Yes, what a stroke of luck."
"Daddy, Mrs. Duck says thank you."
"You're most welcome, Mrs. Duck."
"Now, lets find our house."
I'm sure it's this way.
Hello.
Did you hearsomething?
"Yes, I thought"
I heard someone say.
"Hello, it's Mummy Rabbit"
with Rebecca and Richard.
"Hello, Peppa,"
we're lost.
"Hello, Rebecca,"
we're lost too.
We wanted to
go to the playground.
"So did we,"
but it's too foggy to get there.
"Come on, everyone."
Back to our house
until the fog clears.
"Daddy Pig, do you know"
where you're doing?
"Yes, of course I do,"
this way.
"Yes, Daddy Pig."
"Ah, ha."
I've found our little hill.
We'll soon be home.
Hooray.
Our house should be
just about here.
Oh.
Daddy Pig has found a ladder.
That's strange.
We don't have a ladder
in ourgarden.
Goodness me!
Can you see
where we are Daddy Pig?
"Yes, I can."
"Dad, Where are we?"
Why don't you have a look?
"Wow, wow."
I can see everything again.
The fog is going away.
We're at the playground.
Hooray!
We're at the playground.
"Seesaw, seesaw."
"Daddy, Mummy,"
we're at the playground.
"Well, that's lucky."
But I thought we were
trying to get home.
So did I!
Maybe we did get
a bit lost after all.
 28 Swimming
Swimming
Peppa and herfamily
are at the swimming poll.
Daddy pig is wearing
his swimming costume.
Mummy pig is wearing
herswimming costume.
Peppa is wearing
herswimming costume.
"Hurry up, George!"
Everyone is waiting.
George is wearing
his swimming costume.
"Peppa, George,"
let daddy put on yourarmbands.
"There, George,"
Your armbands make you
look very grown-up.
"Now, me!"
Good!
Now we can go in the water.
Hooray!
It is George's first time
at a swimming pool.
Why don't you put just
one foot into the water?
Maybe you should
try the otherfoot.
Maybe George should try both
feet at the same time.
Good idea.
"Well done, George!"
But you don't need to
splash quite so much.
Here is Rebecca Rabbit
"with her little brother,"
Richard Rabbit.
"Hello, Rebecca!"
"Hello, everyone!"
"Richard, hold onto this float"
and you can practice kicking your legs.
"George, would you like to"
try kicking your legs?
"Very good,"
but try not to splash.
Big children don't splash.
We are very good at swimming.
"When George and Richard are older,"
"they'll be able to swim like us,"
"won't they, Rebecca?"
Yes
Oh!
Richard has a toy watering can.
"Stop it, Richard!"
"Oh, dear,"
Richard has dropped his watering
can into the pool.
Mummy!
"Sorry, Richard,"
I can't reach.
It's too fardown.
Mummy!
I can't swim underwater.
Even I can't swim underwater.
"Mmm, please hold my glasses, mummy pig."
Er
Hooray!
There you go!
"Well done, daddy pig!"
I am rathergood at
swimming underwater.
The watering can is for babies.
Can we jump off the diving
boards above now?
"Sorry, Peppa,"
diving boards are only
forthe grown-ups.
"Cheer up, you two."
You can watch me dive.
"Silly daddy,"
your tummy is too big.
Nonsense!
I won trophies for my diving
when I was younger.
"That's quite a long time ago, daddy pig."
It's lucky I've kept myself
so fit and strong.
"Please hold my glasses, mummy pig."
You'll get a better view
if you watch me from the side.
Please don't splash us
"with water, daddy."
"Of course I won't splash you, Peppa."
I think I need a higher board.
"Please be careful, daddy pig."
"Yes, don't splash us, daddy."
"Don't worry, Peppa."
"Don't splash us with water, daddy."
I told you I wouldn't splash.
Clever daddy.
"Well done, Daddy Pig."
"No need for my towel,"
I've got a special way
of drying myself.
Daddy pig has splashed
everyone with water.
Daddy pig.
"Sorry, everyone."
 29 Tiny Creatures
Tiny creatures
Peppa and George are helping
Grandpa Pig pick vegetables.
"Peppa, here is a lettuce."
"Thank you, Grandpa."
"Oh, what's that? Whaa!"
There's a
horrible monster on it!
Mon-sta!
That's not a monster.
It's just a Little snail.
Oh! Where has he gone?
He's hiding in his shell.
Is that where he lives?
"Yes, it's his house."
"Look,"
he's coming out again.
"Hello, Mr. Snail."
"Grandpa, does Mr. Snail"
have a bed in his house?
"No, Peppa."
"If I were a snail,"
I'd have a bed and a table
and a chair
and a fridge and a television...
"Grandpa, what do snails eat?"
Well!
Mostly they eat my vegetables!
"Hey,"
stop that you cheeky rascal!
Grandpa! George and I want to
play cheeky snails.
These baskets
can be yourshells.
"There, now you look like"
two cheeky snails.
And I am going to eat up
all Grandpa Pig's lettuce.
Oy!
"Keep off my lovely lettuce,"
you cheeky snails.
And when
Grandpa Pig shouts at me
I'll hide in my Little house.
All of Peppa's friends are here.
"Hello, Grandpa Pig."
"Hello, Suzy,"
have you come to play
with Peppa and George?
Yes.
I don't know where they are.
It's just me and
these two snails here.
We are cheeky snails.
Surprise!
We were pretending to be snails!
"Can we be snails, too?"
I don't think I have
enough baskets for you all.
Oooh.
You could be
something else though.
Something exciting
from the garden.
A Carrot?
Rebecca Rabbit likes carrots.
"No, Rebecca, not carrots."
Come over here.
What's that buzzing sound?
It's coming
from that Little house.
"Grandpa,"
why is that doll's house
making a funny buzzing noise?
"That's not a doll's house,"
Peppa.
It's a bee's house.
It's called a hive.
Ooooh.
"Look, here's one now."
What's she doing?
She's collecting
nectar from the flower
and then she flies back to
the hive to make it into honey.
"Hmmm, I like honey."
Let's pretend to be bees.
"Buzz, buzz, buzz."
"Yes, let's be bees."
"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."
My! What busy bees!
"Yes, we're busy bees. Buzz!"
"Now, we must fly back to"
our hive to make honey.
"Buzz, buzz..."
Goodness me!
What do we have here?
Granny! We're busy bees. Buzzz.
Ah! Would you busy
bees like some toast?
"Yes, please!"
And what would you
like on your toast?
Honey!
"That's lucky,"
because that's what I've made:
Toast and honey!
Horray!
I like being a bee because
they eat lots of lovely honey.
I like being a snail because
they eat all Grandpa's lettuce.
Oy! You cheeky rascal!
 30 Daddy Pigs Office
Daddy Pig's office
"Today, as a special treat."
Peppa and George are
visiting Daddy Pig's office.

at your office all day?
Lots of fun things.
You'll see.
This is the building
where Daddy Pig works.
We are here.
Hooray!
Yes?
Hello.
It's Daddy Pig.
"Hello, Daddy Pig."
Can I press the button too?
"Of course, Peppa."
Yes?
It's me.
Hello me.
Come in.
My office is on the top floor.
We have to go up in the lift.
Can I press the button?
I think it's George's turn.
"Press the top button, George."
"The lift is taking Peppa,"
George and Daddy Pig
up to the very top floor.
Wow...
"Top floor, door is opening."
This is Daddy Pig's office.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hello, Daddy Pig."
Mr. Rabbit and Ms. Cat
work with Daddy Pig.
I brought two very special visitors
with me today.
Peppa and George.
What an honor.
Let's begin the tour.
"Mr. Rabbit, can we start at your desk?"
We certainly can.
My job is all about numbers.
I take a very important piece of paper.
"I take a rubberstamp,"
and I stamp the paper.
Wow.
What a great job MR. Rabbit has.
Can I do some stamping?
Of course.
I just find you some paper.
Here are some paper.
Maybe we should use some blank paper.
Here you are.
Peppa likes stamping with rubber stamps.
I like doing MR. Rabbit's job.
On with the tour.
Next up is Mrs. Cat's desk.
"Hello, Peppa and George."
Hello.
My job is all about drawing shapes
on the computer.
Then I print the shapes out.
And here's another copy.
Thank you.
What a nice job MS. Cat has!
Can I have a go?
Maybe it's George's turn now.
"That's right, George."
It's your turn to do some work.
George is making blue triangles.
Now you print them out.
I like doing Ms. Cat's job.
Do you want to see my desk now?
"Yes, please."
This is Daddy Pig's desk.
My job is quite complicated.
"I take big numbers,"
transmit them and calculate
their load bearing tangents.
Daddy Pig's job sounds very important.
Do you use rubber stamps?
No.
Do you use a computer?
No.
But I do use coloring pen.
"Daddy, can we draw"
with yourcoloring pens?
Good idea.
Peppa and George love drawing
with coloring pens.
I am drawing a house.
George is drawing a dinosaur.
George always draws dinosaurs.
Dinosaur!
"My goodness, five o'clock already."
It is home time.
I say!
What a splendid picture of a house.
And what a fierce dinosaur.
George and I have been doing Daddy's job.
And they've been doing it very well.
I like doing MR. Rabbit's job
and I like doing Ms. Cat's job.
But I like doing daddy's job the best.

 32 George Catches a Cold
George catches a cold
"Today, it is raining a little bit."
"Peppa, George,"
Put your rain clothes on.
"With rains, Peppa and George must"
wear their rain clothes.
George does not like
wearing his rain hat.
"George, you must keep your hat on."
Why?
Because you must keep dry.
Why?
Because you might catch a cold.
Why?
"George, do you want to"
play in the garden?
Then keep your hat on.
"Come on, George."
Peppa and George are going to
jump in muddy puddles.
Yak
George does not want to
wear his rain hat.
"Peppa, George, come inside."
The rain is too heavy to play out.
"Oh, George,"
where is your hat?
George has caught a cold.
"Oh, poor little george!"
You don't sound well.
Don't worry.
I'll ring Doctor. Brown Bear.

"Thank you Doctor Brown Bear,"
Good bye.
Would george be taken to hospital
and given medicine?

Let's give you straight to bed.
"George, you have to"
stay in bed for a bit.
No.
George does not
want to stay in bed.
"George, you have to stay in bed"

 33 Traffic Jam
Traffic Jam
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are
making lunch for Peppa and her family.
I've dug up some more potatoes.
"Oh, Grandpa."
We're already got
plenty of potatoes.
You can never have
too many potatoes.
"Ok, But get the potatoes"
"in the oven,"
The others will be here soon.
"Hoho, we've plenty of time."
It's only eleven o'clock.
Peppa and herfamily
are on their way.
I wish we'd set off sooner.
We're going to be late again.
Don't worry. Mummy Pig.
We've still got loads of time.
We're always late when we
go to Granny and Grandpa's.
Not this time.
"I've found a new way,"
that avoids all the traffic.
"Oh, I wasn't expecting that."
Peppa and herfamily
are stuck in a traffic Jam.
"Look, there's Danny Dog"
and Granddad Dog.
Danny Dog and Granddad Dog
"are in the traffic jam, too."
"Hello, Peppa."
We're going to my Granny
and Grandpa's for lunch.
We're going to be late.
It's one o'clock.
They're late as usual.
How are your potatoes doing?
Er. They still need
a bit more cooking.
Granny Pig speaking.
"Hello, Granny Pig."
We're stuck in a traffic jam.
"Don't worry,"
"we're running late, too."
Grandpa's gone over
the top with potatoes.
See you in a bit.
The poor dears are
stuck in a traffic jam.
Sounds like I've got time to
get a few more potatoes.
Grandpa Pig!
We're moving so slowly.
We'll neverget to
Granny and grandpa's.
Peppa's right.
We have to try
a different way.
But there aren't
any other main roads.
I know a shortcut.
"Bye bye, everyone!"
We're taking a shortcut.
"Bye bye, Peppa."
Good luck!
Mummy Pig is taking a shortcut
to get ahead of the traffic.
The shortcut is very bumpy.
This is fun.
Are you sure about this?
Trust me.
"Hello, ducks."
We're taking a shortcut.
Look! There's the main road again.
Well done! Mummy Pig.
But we've still
behind Danny's lorry.
"Hello, welcome back!"
"Oh, dear!"
Mummy Pig's shortcut
has not worked very well.
Good! Lunch is ready.
And most important of all:
The potatoes are done!
Lunch is ready.
But Peppa and herfamily
are still not here.
Grandpa Pig speaking.
We're almost at your house.
But the traffic is still moving
at the speed of a snail.
"A very, very slow snail."
They're almost here.
But they're still
in the traffic jam.
Poordears.
The food is going to get cold.
I've got an idea.
I'll get my wheelbarrow.
What is Grandpa Pig doing?
Granny Pig!
Load the lunch
into the wheelbarrow.
"Aye, aye, Grandpa Pig."
If they can't come to the lunch.
We have to take the lunch to them.
Look! There's Granny and Grandpa
with our lunch in a wheelbarrow.
"Ahoy, there!"
Lunch is served.
Is there enough for Danny and
"Granddad Dog to have some, too?"
We've got enough foreveryone.
Hooray! Potatoes.
Good job!
You did lots and
"lots of potatoes, Grandpa."
You can never have
too many potatoes.
 34 Bedtime
Bedtime
It is almost bedtime.
Peppa and George are
just finishing their supper.
Daddy Pig!
"Oh, sorry. I'm a bit tired."
It's been a long day.
George and I aren. T sleepy at all.
Can we play in the garden?
But it's almost your bedtime!
Can we play out side
for just a tiny bit?
"Please, Mummy!"
"Please, Daddy!"
All right.
But you must come in
when we call you for your bath.
I don't know where they
get their energy from.
Peppa and George are playing one last game
outside before bedtime.
"Look, George!"
Lots of muddy puddles!
Peppa and George
are wearing their boots.
They are going to jump up
and down in muddy puddles.
Peppa loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles.
George loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles.
Look!
The biggest puddle in the world!
"What a huge, big puddle!"
Peppa! George! Bathtime.
Daddy! Mummy!
We found the biggest
muddy puddle in the world.
I can see that.
"Quick, into the bath."
"Oh, Can't we just play outside"
a bit longer?
"No, it's bathtime."
Are you and George feeling sleepy?
"No, Daddy."
We are not even a tiny bit sleepy.
"Peppa and George might not be sleepy,"
but I am.
"Me, too!"
"Before bedtime,"
Peppa and George have their bath.
Peppa likes splashing.
George likes splashing.
Peppa and George both like splashing.
That's enough splashing.
Let. S get you dry and into your pajamas.
"Oh, can't we just stay"
in the bath a little bit longer.
Bathtime is over!
"Now, it's time to clean your teeth."
"Before going to bed,"
Peppa and George brush theirteeth.
"OK, that's enough brushing."
Into your beds!
"Oh, I think our teeth"
need a bit more cleaning.
"When you're in bed,"
Daddy Pig will read you a story.
Hooray.
Peppa and George like stories.
"When Peppa goes to bed,"
she always has her Teddy
tucked up with her.
"When George goes to bed,"
he always has Mr. Dinosaur
tucked up whth him.
Are you feeling sleepy now?
"No, Daddy."
We need lots and lots of stories.
Daddy Pig will read you one story.
"Now, which book do you want?"
"Um, ""The Red Monkey""book."
"OK, I'll read you"
The Red Monkeybook.
Peppa and George like the
The Red Monkey book.
Onec upon a time...
"Oh, sorry, Daddy Pig."
Once upon a time
"there was a Red Monkey,"
and this Red Monkey had a bath.
And cleaned his teeth.
He got into his bed.
And soon he fell fast asleep.
"Good night, Red Monkey."
Peppa and George are asleep.
"Goodnight, Peppa and George!"
Sleep well!
"Now, Peppa and George are asleep."
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig
are going to watch some television.
And now it's time for
The amazing Mr. Potato.
I've been looking forward to
watching this program.
The Amazing Mr. Potato

He runs fast.
He jumps high.
He neversleeps.
It is bedtime for Peppa and George.
And it looks as if it is bedtime
for Mummy and Daddy too.
 35 Jumble Sale
Jumble Sale
It is a rainy day and the
school roof has a hole in it.
Children!
We are going to
have a jumble sale.
The money we raise will pay for
a new school roof.
Horray!
Everyone has to bring something
for the jumble sale.
What should we bring?
You can bring an old toy or
something you don't use anymore.
The parents have arrived
to pick up the children.
Home time!
Don't forget your old toys
forthe jumble sale tomorrow.
Peppa is choosing a toy
for the jumble sale.
"Peppa, have you decided?"
Ummm...
You only have to choose one toy.
"Yes, and it will help pay"
for a new school roof.
Ok. I'm going to give...
Mr. Dinosaur!
Waaaaaaaaa!
Mr. Dinosaur is
George's favourite toy.
"Peppa, you can't"
give away Mr. Dinosaur.
Can't I?
No.
"Oh bother! Sorry, George."
Dine-saw.
Why don't you give
your old jack-in-a-box.
Ok.
"Now, it's your turn, Daddy!"
What?
We must all give something to
the jumble sale.
I'm giving this hat and
George is giving this ball.
So what shall Daddy give?
"I know, the television?"
Not the telly!
No! It's too useful.
"Ummmm, I know."
Daddy's smelly slippers?
No! Too smelly.
I know! Daddy's old chair.
But that's an antique.
What does an-tique mean?
Antique means it's
very old and valuable.
But you found it on
"a rubbish tip, Daddy Pig."
It's worthless.
It'll be worth a lot of
money when I mend it.
You've been saying
"that for ages, Daddy Pig."
"I know, I'll give these,"
lovely socks that
Granny Pig made me.
Good!
I've come to collect yourthings
forthe jumble sale.
Here they are.
Thank you!
And would you
like this old chair?
"Oh, most generous! Good-bye."
Bye bye.
"Mummy,"
you gave away Daddy. S chair.
Shhh! Don't tell him.
He'll never notice.
It is the day of
the jumble sale.
Hello.
"Hello, Miss Rabbit."
Peppa! How about this chair?
It's a bit rubbish
but you can chop it up
and use it for firewood.
But it' an antique.
Is it?
Daddy says it's
worth lots of money.
"Well, I never."
I'd better put the price up.
Bye.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hello, Peppa."
"What did you give, Suzy?"
I gave my nurse's outfit.
I gave my parrot balloon.
I gave my toy monkey.
I will miss my jack-in-a-box.
"Can I buy this jack-in-abox,"
please?
And I'd like
this nurse's outfit.
"The parrot balloon, please."
"Mummy, mummy,"
look what we've bought.
All your old toys!
We missed them.
Look what I've bought!
Lt. S an antique chair!
"Oh, Daddy Pig!"
That's not an antique chair.
It is! Miss Rabbit just said so.
And it matches my old one.
"Yes, Daddy, that's because..."
Shhh! Peppa.
...it is your old chair.
What?
But Miss Rabbit has just
charged me lots of money for it!
"Fantasic news, everybody."
We have just

"A toy car! Well done, Danny!"
"Can I have a ticket, please?"
"Thank you, Peppa."
What are you hoping to win?

All aboard!
"Hurry up, Daddy Pig!"
Hop aboard!
"Quick, Daddy!"
Splice the main brace!
Chocks away! Full steam ahead!
"Very impressive, Miss Rabbit."
You must be an expert pilot.
"Not really, this the first time"
I've everflown a balloon.
Oh...
Hold Tight!
Miss Rabbit heats up
the air in the balloon
to make it rise into the sky.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Would anyone like to
do the map reading?
I will.
"Are you sure, Daddy Pig?"
I'm very good at map reading.
Oh... this map is a bit difficult.
Shall we go higher?
"Yes, please! Higher! Higher!"
The balloon is rising high
into the sky.
Oh! Where did the sky go!
"Don't worry, Peppa,"
we're just flying
through a cloud.
Oooh.
"Wow, the sky is back again!"
Horray.
"Big balloon, big balloon,"
biggerthan the sun and moon.
"Flying high, in the sky,"
fly and fly and fly and fly...
"Look, Teddy,"
we're flying really high.
"Peppa,"
be careful you don't drop...
Teddy! I've dropped Teddy!
"Don't worry, Peppa."
We'll rescue Teddy.
"Hold tight, everybody!"
We're going down!
Miss Rabbit is making
the balloon go down
so that Teddy can be rescued.
I can't see Teddy anywhere.
There he is!
Teddy's caught in a tree.
I can use this anchor
to rescue Teddy.
"Slowly, slowly. There!"
Daddy Pig has rescued Teddy.
Teddy!
Horray!
Oh dear!
No one is looking
where they are going.
Look out! Tree straight ahead!
Hold tight!
Oh!
First Teddy was stuck in a tree
and now we are stuck in a tree.
"Daddy Pig,"
do you know where we are?
Hmmm.
"We. Re lost, aren't we?"
Yes.
Oooh.
"Look, everyone!"
Thats Granny

in Grandpa Pig's garden!
As I thought.
"Ahoy there,"
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig!
Goodness me!
"Ahoy there, Miss Rabbit!"

"Grandpa, we can't get down!"
Don't worry. I've got a ladder.
Horray!
Everyone climbs down
from the big balloon.
Granny! Grandpa!
Miss Rabbit took us for a ride
in her big balloon.
How very exciting.
I'm afraid
the most exciting thing
we can offer is a piece of
my homemade chocolate cake.
Homemade chocolate cake!
That is exciting!
That was the best
balloon ride ever!
Hmmm. And that was the best
chocolate cake ever!
 37 Painting
Painting
Peppa and George
are painting today.
We need some old newspaper
to put on the table.
Yes!
Daddy pig is reading
his newspaper.
You could have my newspape
r when I finish reading it.
All right!
Hooray!
Now we can start painting.
Silly George!
Big children do not
put their hands in the paint.
George loves painting with his hands.
Peppa loves painting
with her hands.
Very good.
"Can I have a potato, mummy pig?"
"They aren't cooked yet, daddy pig"
"Are you hungry, daddy?"
I am not going to eat it.
Watch this!
What is daddy pig doing?
Now who can tell
me what this is.
Aflower!
Clever daddy!
I loved painting
when I was a young piggy.
Now where are
my old painting things.
"Daddy, why are you"
wearing that funny hat?
"This is my beret,"
it puts me in the mood
for painting pictures.
Now what shall I paint?
"Well chosen, George."
I'll paint the old cherry tree.
What's that?
"It's an easel, Peppa."
It hold my canvas.
What's the canvas?
It's big like paper for
very special paintings.
Is that toothpaste?
"No, Peppa,"
These are special paints
forgrown-up artist.
There!
What color should
we begin with?
"Red, please!"
"Why red, Peppa?"
Red is my favorite color.
But first we need to paint the sky.
Look! What color is it?
"Blue, of course."
Very good.
Let's start with blue.
Now forthe cherry tree.
We need green for the leaves.
But there isn't any green.
Never mind!
If we mix blue paint
"with yellow paint,"
we can make green.
Mixing blue and yellow
makes green.
Ohhhhhh
What lovely green leaves!
And here's some grass...
What about the brown branches?
We haven't got brown paint.
We can make brown.
We'll mix the green and the red.
Mixing green and red
makes brown.
Daddy pig paints the tree trun
k and the branches.
Whah!
"Daddy, can I paint the cherries?"
"Yes, Peppa,"
put your fingers in the paint
and dab it onto the tree.
"One, two, three."
Well done!
Now it's George's turn.
What a great painter
"you are, George!"
"There, the painting is finished."
Hooray!
"Oh, it's the ducks."
"Hello, Mrs. Duck"
We are painting a picture.
The ducks are running
through daddy's paint.
Shoo! Shoo!
Naughty ducks!
Shoo! Ducks! Shoo!
Stay away from my painting.
"Oh, no!"
The ducks have made paint
footprints all overthe painting.
"Oh, dear!"
What was all that noisy?
"Mummy, the ducks have"
spoiled our painting.
"Mmmm, let me see."
The ducks are making paint footprints in the
garden just like the ones on the painting.
"Daddy's painting isn't spoiled, Peppa."
It's perfect!
Hooray!
"Oh, Yes."
I am a bit of an expert at painting.
And so are the ducks.

"Hello, Peppa."
"Oh, good."
I see you two are friends again.
We are not friends.
We will never be friends again.
I think it's about time
you two make it up.
"Peppa, say sorry to Suzy."
Only she says sorry first.
"I know, I will count to three,"
and you can both say sorry
at the same time.
All right!
"One, two, three."
Sorry.
Now you can be best friends again.
Hooray!
"Suzy, let's play mini golf."
Good idea!
Peppa and Suzy are best friends again.
Me first!
My go!
"My ball went into the hole, so I win."
"But my ball knocked it in, so I win."
"You are just making the rules up, ."
You are making the rules up.
I win!
"No, I win!"
You two are just the same.
That's why Suzy is my best friend
in the whole world.
And Peppa is my best friend
in the whole world ever.
 45 The Toy Cupboard
The toy cupboard
It is Peppa and George's bedtime.
"Goodness me, why are"
all these toys in your bed?
That's where they live.
"Quickly, put the toys away"
in yourtoy basket.
But the toy basket is full.
"Oh, so it is,"
maybe you need a toy cupboard.
"Yes, I could make one tomorrow."
"The last thing you made,"
"daddy pig, was this shelf."
I am very proud of that shelf.
But daddy it's all wobbly.
We use it as a slide.
The teddy and Mr. Dinosaur.
"All right, let's buy a new toy cupboard."
We can buy one now on the computer.
Hooray!
Mummy pig is using the computer
to buy a toy cupboard.
"Aha, now which one should we get?"
"Can we have this one, please?"
"That looks perfect,"
mummy pig is buying the toy cupboard.
"Congratulations, yourtoy"
cupboard is ordered.
"Oh, goody."
It is morning.
And the Mr. Zebra the postman
has a special delivery.
Post!
Special delivery for MS. Peppa pig
and masterGeorge.
What is it?
It's a toy cupboard.
"Oh, It looks a bit flat."
"Yes, you built it yourself."
Oh...
"Don't worry, Peppa,"
it'll be very easy for
your mummy and daddy to build.
"Goodbye, bye bye, bye..."
Now what do we do?
Now we build yourtoy cupboard.
That's strange.
There aren't any instructions.
Maybe it's so easy to build it
doesn't need instructions.
"Mummy, can we help?"
"Yes, first, I need a shelf."
Here is a green shelf.
"Thank you, peppa,"
now I need four legs.
"One, two, three, four."
"Four blue legs, mummy"
"Lovely, we'll have this done in no time."
"Here is red door, mummy pig."
"Thank you, daddy pig."
"There, finished."
"Well done, mummy pig."
It's very tiny.
How would all our toy fit inside?
It's a little small.
"Oh, George has found another bit."
"Oh, maybe that is a spare shelf."
And these would be bits too
"Oh, dear, the cupboard is tiny,"
because mummy pig has not
used all the pieces.
We'll just have to take it apar
t and start again.
"Oh, no."
If only we have the instructions.
Who can that be?
"Hello, I just found these in my van."
It's the missing instructions.
That would make things a lot easier.
Hooray.
The instructions look very complicated.
"It's no good,"
it's nonsense.
"Leave it to me, daddy pig."
I am quite enjoy
putting these things together.
Really?
Can we help it anyway?
You can put the kettle on.
I'll have a nice cup of tea
"with six sugars, please"
Everyone is preparing tea
and biscuits for Mr. Zebra.
"Tea time, Mr. Zebra."
Wow...
Mr. Zebra has built the toy cupboard.
"My goodness, that was quick."
"Yeah, and I've put all your toys in there too."
"Thank you, Mr. Zebra."
But there is no room for these last two.
"Oh, poor teddy and Mr. Dinosaur."
Where are they going to live?
Why not simply orderanther easy
to make cupboard?
No!
I've got a better idea.
Teddy and Mr. Dinosaur
can live on your beds.
"But mummy, that is"
where they lived before.
"Yes, I know."
That's why it. S such a good idea.
 46 School Camp

"Suzy, shall we share a tent?"
I said I'd share with Zoe.
"Oh, sorry Suzy,"
I said I'd share with Rebecca.
"Rebecca, you said you'd share with me."
"Oh, yes."
"Emily, who you are going to share tent with?"
Zoe!
Ok!
"Good, now you can share with me."
OK!
Now I need sticks to make a campfire.

"Madam gazelle,"
I am a bit scared.
Would you like to come in?
"Yes, please."
"Madam gazelle,"
I think I am a bit scared too.
"Can I come in, please?"
Of course.
I think I might be scared later.
I might be scared later too.
And me...
"Come in, everyone."

 47 Captian Daddy Pig
Captain Daddy Pig
Peppa and her family are
borrowing grandpa's boat for the day.
"Remember, Daddy Pig,"
push the lever forward to go forward.
"Aye-aye, Grandpa Pig."
Forward.
And back to go back.
"And Back, simple."
"And please look after my boat,"
I just had it painted.
"Oh, Grandpa Pig,"
what an old fusspot you are.
Are my crew ready?
"Yes, captain Daddy Pig."
Then let's go.
"Oh, the boat is moving backwards."
"Ah, watch out forthe bridge."
Oops!
"Oh, that was close."
Byebye. Byebye.
Have a lovely time.
I hope my boat comes back in one piece.
"Stop worrying, It will be fine."
"Peppa, ring the bell."
"Aye-aye, captain daddy."
I am a bit hungry.
So am I.
Granpa has left us a picnic in the galley.
What's a galley?
A galley is the boat's little kitchen.
Follow me.
Peppa and George go inside the boat.
"Wow, what a tiny little kitchen."
Where's the picnic?
That obvious place would be here.
That's not the picnic.
And it must be here.
And that's not the picnic.
This kitchen has everything in the wrong place.
Wow! ATV.
Daddy can not find the picnic.
It's impossible.
"If this was my kitchen,"
"the picnic would be here,"
"Well done, Peppa,"
Peppa has found the picnic.
Delicious!
"Oh, it's the ducks."
"Hello, Mrs. Duck."
Would you like some bread?
Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.
"Look out, long reeds ahead."
"Don't worry, grandpa's boat"
will easily go through them.
Are we stuck?
"No, we can reverse."
Now are we stuck?
Yes.
"Oh, dear,"
grandpa's boat is stuck in the reeds.
I'll just give it a little push.
"Do be careful, Daddy Pig."
I know what I'm doing.
"When I say go, start the engine."
"Aye-aye, captain Daddy Pig."
Go!
Daddy Pig has pushed the boat out of the reeds.
Hooray!
"Quick, daddy,"
jump back on the boat.
"Oh, no,"
Daddy Pig is being left behind.
"Swim faster, daddy."
Stop the engine.
What's he saying?
Stop the engine.
"Daddy says, stop the engine."
Oh!
"Are you ok, Daddy Pig?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
But let's head for home before
we have any more adventures.
"Aye -aye, captain Daddy Pig."
They've been gone for ages.
I hope my boat's alright.
"Look, there they are."
Hello.
"Hi, There!"
I'll just park the boat.
"You park a car, but you moor a boat,"
I'll show you.
Grandpa Pig is going to moorthe boat.
The secret of mooring is to do it carefully.
"My, the bridge."
What?
Look behind you.
Ah!
"Oh, I didn't mean to do that."
Grandpa has broken his boat.
"Never mind, Grandpa Pig."
You can have lots of fun mending it.
It is true that I love mending things.
"Can I help mend the boat, Grandpa Pig?"
"Of course you can, Peppa."
 48 The Powercut
The Powercut
It is evening.
Peppa and George are in the sitting room
dancing to their favourite song.
Daddy pig is in the hallway
vacuuming the carpet.
"And Mummy pig is in her study,"
doing her important work on her computer.
OH!
"Mummy, daddy,"
it's gone all dark and the music is broken.
And my vacuum won't work.
And my computer has switched off.
Mummy pig tries the light switch.
But the lights do not come on.
It must be a power cut.
What's a power cut?
A power cut is when there is no electricity.
What's the electricity?
Electricity is what makes everything
in our house work.
Will electricity come back again?
"Yes, but in the meantime,"
we need to find a torch.
I think there's a torch is in the cellar...
"Ok, I'll go and get it."
"Will you be okay, daddy?"
"Hoho, I'll be fine."
I can see very well in the dark.
Who put that there...
Oh.
Daddy! Are you okay?
"Yeah, it's just a bit dark down here."
"Oh, I just remembered."
I think the torch is in the kitchen.
"Aha, mummy pig has found the touch."
"Can I hold the torch, mummy?"
Okay!
George! Look at me!
Peppa is making a funny face.
"Don't worry, George, it's only Peppa."
"Oh, we'd bettertold daddy we found the torch."
"Daddy is still in the cellar,"
looking forthe torch.
I am sure it is here somewhere.
"Daddy, we've found the torch."
"Luckily, it was in the kitchen all the time."
What a stroke of luck!
Now we just have to wait until
the electricity comes back.
"How long will that be, exactly?"
"I would say, exactly a long time."
"Oh, but George and I"
want to do some dancing.
I know what we can do.
We can watch the television.
"Oh, it won't go on."
The tv needs electricity too.
Does it?
Yes.
"Oh, now what are we going to do?"
In the olden days
when there was no television
children would have to
made up theirown games.
"I know, I need a cardboard box."
What is Peppa doing?
"Mummy, would you cut a hole"
in this box for me?
What for?
You'll see.
Mummy pig is cutting a hole
in the cardboard box.
"There you are, Peppa."
Thank you.
"No you all have to sit down there,"
"and George,"
you have to point this torch on me.
Welcome to Peppa pig news
"with me, Peppa pig."
Peppa has made herown television.
Today the whole world stop working
when there was a powercut
and all the electricity was lost.
"Very good, Peppa."
Daddy pig says the electricity won't be back
fora long long time.
"Oh, the electricity is back."
Hooray!
SHush! I haven't finished yet.
Switch the lights off.
"Okay, Peppa."
Good.
I have some very important news.
The queen has just found
some more electricity
and says that everyone
can now be happy again.
"Every good, Peppa!"
Hooray!

in the garden with their ball.
Wee... George throws the ball as high as
he can and catches it.
I can do that too.

"Oh, Peppa has missed the ball."
This is a silly game.
Here is Peppa's best friend Suzy sheep.

"Hello, Peppa. Hello, Suzy."
Let's play tennis.
"Yes, that sounds fun."
"To you, Suzy."
"Oh, Suzy has missed the ball."
"Oh, Peppa has missed the ball."
Peppa and Suzy like playing tennis.

George is going to be the ball boy. He has
to collect the ball when it is hit too far.

I am the goalkeeper.
"Go, Rebecca, go. Goal."
Hooray!
The goal is not allowed.
"Yes, it is. No, it isn't."
"Yes, it is. No, it isn't."
What a lot of noise!
"Daddy, the boys are cheating."
"No, the girls are cheating."
It's sounds like
you need a referee.
What's a referee?
It's someone who make sure
that everyone plays fair.
I'll be the referee.
Me... me... me...
Stop! Stop!
I'll be the referee.
The next team to get a goal

Quick! Score a goal.
Stop them.
